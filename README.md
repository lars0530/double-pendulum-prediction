# Double Pendulum Prediction

Double Pendulum Prediction is a project where I create a game with a double pendulum where one can "bet" on when the bottom pendulum has done it's last loop.

There will be an animation of the pendulum and at some point the energy runs out (i will do somewhat of a physics simulation to take energy from the system due to resistance). There is a button that you can press when you think it has done it's last loop. 

Two players play it and the one that presses the button first while being correct wins. If they are first, but it loops again, they loose.

It is not yet decided, whether it is worse to click the button to early or too late. You loose in both scenarios.
